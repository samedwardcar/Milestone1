# Milestone1
First milestone project, recreating the filler pigeon iPhone game.

Started with playing the game to see the different elements and functions I would need to use.

got stuck on the basic principle of the selecting arrays which help me up a little bit. No using a ticTac game I code to set the game up on a smaller scale before move code to the full game file.

My project is not done. Please use main or replit branches as I will be creating a third to continue working on the project.
Thank you.

Game Rules:

    Each player is assigned a corner tile at the start of the game (bottom left)
    Players take turns filling their tiles with one of 6 colors in an attempt to capture adjacent
    tiles of the same color
    You cannot change the color of your tiles into the color of your opponent's tiles
    The game ends when there are no more tiles to occupy
    he player with the most tiles wins
