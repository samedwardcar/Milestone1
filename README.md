# Milestone1
First milestone project, recreating the filler pigeon iPhone game.

Started with playing the game to see the different elements and functions I would need to use.

got stuck on the basic principle of the selecting arrays which help me up a little bit. No using a ticTac game I code to set the game up on a smaller scale before move code to the full game file.
